  keep track of changes and history in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
  It doesn't contain a file instead it is a list of what will be in the next
  commit
What value do you think it offers?
  Allows you to logically orginize commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  The staging area provides a list of files that are ready for commit. This
  allow you to pick and chose which files you want to batch for the commit. If
  you have files that fit the logical change, then you don't have to add them
  to the staging area. If they're already there, can remove them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  a) experimental changes that may affect the working code

  b) Demo Code

  c) Testing code

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  They allow you to visualize the project history with its branches. This
  is helpful for tracking changes to the project.
