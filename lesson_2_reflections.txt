  keep track of changes and history in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
  It doesn't contain a file instead it is a list of what will be in the next
  commit
What value do you think it offers?
  Allows you to logically orginize commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  The staging area provides a list of files that are ready for commit. This
  allow you to pick and chose which files you want to batch for the commit. If
  you have files that fit the logical change, then you don't have to add them
  to the staging area. If they're already there, can remove them.

  c) Testing code

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  They allow you to visualize the project history with its branches. This
  is helpful for tracking changes to the project.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  a) the branch that is receives the merge now has the history of the branch
  which means the next person to clone the branch will get the complete history
  of the merge.

  b) it gives the user a visual of when the branch deveated from the original.

 What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
 manually?

 Pros - git will merge everything that can be merged saving you the hassel of
 figuring it out. git will display a list of conflicts giving you the
 responsiblity of fixing them.

 Cons - User intervention on conflicts.
